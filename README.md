# Stock & ETF Research Dashboard v2

## What changed
- No hardcoded stock/ETF universe in the runtime path.
- On each analysis run, the dashboard refreshes the current NSE equity security list and NSE ETF security list. NSE publishes these as separate current CSV files. citeturn1view0
- `stock_universe.json` is empty by default. Populate it only if you intentionally want a custom universe.
- Latest available market price/history comes from Yahoo Finance. Historical data supports the technical calculations; it should not be described as a guaranteed tick-by-tick NSE feed. Yahoo Finance supports market-data downloads across daily and intraday intervals, subject to its data limitations. citeturn0search3
- News retrieval now queries each shortlisted symbol plus a broader Indian-market query.
- Deterministic challenge reviews are always generated, even without an LLM API key.
- Optional OpenRouter LLM review remains available.
- Every run is persisted under `logs/` with a timestamped log and `stock_etf_latest.log`.
- Age and investment capital are available in the sidebar and are persisted with the analysis.
- Capital produces allocation context based on the quantitative ranking. It does not change the raw market score.

## Run
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Data-source behavior
The official NSE page lists the current equity and ETF security CSV files and was updated in September 2026. citeturn0search0

If NSE is unavailable, the dashboard uses the last successfully downloaded `cache/nse_universe.json`. If there is no cache and no custom universe, the run fails clearly instead of silently producing zero instruments.


## v5 fixes

- Dynamically discovers the current NSE stock and ETF universe.
- Applies a lightweight liquidity screen before downloading 3 years of detailed history.
- Limits detailed analysis to `ANALYSIS_UNIVERSE_LIMIT` (default 250).
- Handles missing Yahoo Finance fundamentals without failing the whole instrument.
- Uses per-symbol Google News RSS plus Yahoo Finance search as news providers, with a market-news fallback.
- Persists provider errors in `market.news_errors` so an empty news tab is diagnosable.
- Keeps deterministic challenge reviews independent of LLM availability.


### News v5
Uses yfinance news, Yahoo Finance search, Google News RSS, and Bing News RSS with provider diagnostics and live search-link fallback.


### News scope
The news layer intentionally covers direct company/ticker news plus India macro/policy, global macro, geopolitics, trade/sanctions, commodities, technology policy, environment, climate, pollution, extreme weather, and sector-specific developments. Indirect news is retained when it can affect demand, input costs, regulation, supply chains, financing conditions, or business continuity.
